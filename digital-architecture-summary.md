# high performance architecture
# steps for deriving architecture
- find the goal of solution architecture
    - find the business driver
    - perform market research
    - review 10 principles
    - draw big picture view
    - questions
        - what are the goals
        - is there any player
        - what are the principle to apply
        - what is the big picture view
- draw the logical architecture
    - identify the logical layers
    - find out the the right architectural style
    - find out the right buidling block
- detail the logical architecture

        - microservices design patterns
    - questions
        - can I manp the component of cloud native reference architecture
        - are the existing app 12 factor compliant
        - where can we apply microservices and why
        - what lifecycle and design consideration should stay valid
        - can I apply microservices design pattern
        - where can I apply serverless constructs
